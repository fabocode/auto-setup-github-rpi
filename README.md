# Auto-setup Github for Raspberry Pi 
 Since I usually test a lot of OSs in my Raspberry Pi for work purposes, I created this bash script to do an auto setup into my Raspberry Pi. 

# Usage
 Call the program by passing the required github `username` and `email`.
 ```c
 sh setup_git.sh -u username -e email
 ```
